"""
Project API Endpoints (Controller Layer)

Thin HTTP controllers that delegate to service layer.
Responsibilities: HTTP concerns only (request/response, status codes, auth).

Architecture Pattern: Controller (MVC/Clean Architecture)
- Parse HTTP requests → DTOs
- Call service layer (business logic lives there)
- Map domain entities → HTTP responses
- Handle HTTP-specific errors (4xx, 5xx)

Does NOT:
- Contain business logic (that's in ProjectService)
- Know about database (that's in repositories)
- Manipulate domain entities directly (use service methods)
